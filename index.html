        My first day in Redeemers was on a Sunday afternoon. I had left my home at
        Lekki Ajah in the morning and it took me a few hours to get to the
        school's location. Unfortunately my parents couldn't come with me, so I
        entered public transport by myself.

        On getting to Akoda bus stop I entered a cab that went straight to my
        hostel, the Prophet Moses Extension Hall. I was checked in, signed, and
        given the key to my room. When I entered, the room was quite dirty. I
        prayed over the room and cleaned it up, arranged my things and slept off
        a bit.

        I woke up in the evening to walk around and find where to get food. I
        bought Indomie and egg, went back to my hostel and ate while watching a
        movie. After which I lay on my bed and slept off.
